#The code book

#Experimental design and background:

This study came from the University of California Irvine's Machine Learning department.  A description of the experiement can be
found here:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The data itself came from experiments that were carried out by SmartLabs in Italy with a group of 30 volunteers aged 19-48 years.
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a
smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, SmartLabs captured 3-axial linear
acceleration measures and 3-axial angular velocity measures at a constant rate of 50Hz. The obtained dataset was randomly
partitioned into two sets, training and test, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30%
for generating the test data.

#Raw data:
The raw data can be dowloaded here and is also included in this repo:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip


The dataset includes the following files which were used:
Labels and descriptions:
  - 'README.txt':  Shows general information about the experiement.
  - 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
  - 'features.txt': List of all features.
  - 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
The training data set:
  - 'train/X_train.txt': Each row identifies a series of measurements for a given subject and activity.  There are 561 columns
                         of data that were measured.  The columns are named in the 'features.txt' file.
  - 'train/y_train.txt': Each row identifies the activity that was being performed.  Its range is from 1 to 6.  The numbers
                         are linked to labels using the file 'activity_labels.txt'
  - 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
The test data sets are structured the same as the training data sets:
  - 'test/X_test.txt'
  - 'test/y_test.txt'
  - 'test/subject_test.txt'

The dataset also includes the following directories which were ignored:
- train/Inertial Signals/
- test/Inertial Signals/

All of the data is expressed in standard gravity units 'g' and has been normalized and bounded within [-1,1].

The data has rows that repeat combinations of subject and activity for the differet measures.  This is because the sensor
signals were sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window) but they were not labeled
with a time variable.

The data labels have titles that indicate different components of the data test.
- The first node is 't' or 'f' and indicates whether the feature came from the time or the frequency domain.
- The second node is 'Body' or 'Gravity' and indicates whether the feature came directly from a body measurement or whether
  it was filtered into just a gravity component.
- The third node is 'Acc' or 'Gyro' and indicates whether the feature came from the accelerometer or the gyroscope.
- The next two nodes are optional and there can be one or the other or both.  One option may be 'Jerk' which indicates the
  body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals.  Another option may be 'Mag" which
  indicates the magnitude calculated using the Euclidian norm.
- The next node shows what type of measurement it was.  mean() for mean value, std() for standard deviation, and meanFreq() for
  the weighted average of the frequency components.
- The final node is optional and shows 'X','Y', or 'Z' for those components that were measured over three axes.

The complete list of variables of each feature vector is available in 'features.txt'

#Processed data:

The processed data is a compilation of the raw data.  The training and test data sets were brought together as described
in the ReadME file.  The labels were then tidied according to the ReadME file.  The summary is here.
